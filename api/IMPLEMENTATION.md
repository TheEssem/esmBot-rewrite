# esmBot Image API
The esmBot image API is a combined HTTP and WebSocket API. The default port to access the API is 3762. The API supports very basic authentication, which is defined on the server via the `PASS` environment variable and is sent from the client via the Authentication header in both HTTP and WS requests.

## HTTP

### GET `/image/?id=<job id>`
Get image data after job is finished running. The Content-Type header is properly set.

### GET `/count`
Get the current amount of running jobs. Response is a plaintext number value.

## WebSockets
A client sends *requests* (T-messages) to a server, which subsequently *replies* (R-messages) to the client.
### Message IDs
- Rerror 0x01
- Tqueue 0x02
- Rqueue 0x03
- Tcancel 0x04
- Rcancel 0x05
- Twait 0x06
- Rwait 0x07
- Rinit 0x08
- Rsent 0x09

### Messages
[n] means n bytes.
[s] means a string that goes until the end of the message.
[j] means JSON data that goes until the end of the message.
`tag` is used to identify a request/response pair, like `lock` in the original API. `jid` is used to identify a job. `job` is a job object.
- Rerror tag[2] error[s]
- Tqueue tag[2] jid[8] job[j]
- Rqueue tag[2]
- Tcancel tag[2] jid[8]
- Rcancel tag[2]
- Twait tag[2] jid[8]
- Rwait tag[2]
- Rinit tag[2] max_jobs[2] running_jobs[2] formats[j]
- Rsent tag[2]

### Job Object
The job object is formatted like this:
```js
{
  "cmd": string,       // name of internal image command, e.g. caption
  "path": string,      // canonical image URL, used for getting the actual image
  "url": string,       // original image URL, used for message filtering
  "params": {          // content varies depending on the command, some common parameters are listed here
    "type": string,    // mime type of output, should usually be the same as input
    "togif": boolean,  // convert output to gif
    ...
  },
  "name": string,      // filename of the image, without extension
  "ephemeral": string, // whether to post the output as an ephemeral message (only when responding directly, see below section)
  "spoiler": string    // whether to post the output as a spoiler (only when responding directly, see below section)
}
```

### Direct Posting
The image API will attempt to respond to a command by itself if all of the following criteria is met:
- The original request was done through an interaction/slash command
- The bot's application/user ID is specified on the API server through the `CLIENT_ID` environment variable
- The incoming job object has an interaction token set in the job object with the key `token`
- The output data is a PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WEBP
- The output data is less than 25 MB
